## Overview

The Lotide project is inspired by the [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) project, which is a utility library for JavaScript. While Lodash itself is quite powerful, our version of it is simpler in order to focus on learning the fundamentals of programming and data management using JavaScript.

## Function Definitions

In this library you will find the following functions that perform the following actions:

- `assertEqual` : a function that takes in 2 values and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise
- `head` : a function that takes in an array and returns the first element in the array
- `tail` : a function that takes in an array and returns everything except the first element of the array
- `eqArrays` : a function that takes in 2 arrays and returns true if the arrays are equal and false otherwise
- `assertArraysEqual` : a function that takes in 2 arrays and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise
- `without` : a function that takes in a source array and an itemsToRemove arrays and returns only the items from the source array that are not in the itemsToRemove array
- `flatten` : a function that takes in an array that contains elements including nested array of elements and returns a flattened version of the array
- `middle` : a function that takes in an array and returns middle most element of the array
- `countOnly` : a function that takes in a collection of items and returns a specific subset of those items
- `countLetters` : a function that takes in a sentence and returns a count of each of the letters in the sentence
- `letterPositions` : a function that takes in a string and returns all indices of letter positions in the string
- `findKeyByValue` : a function that takes in an object and a value and returns the first key that corresponds to that value
- `eqObjects` : a function that takes in 2 objects and return true if they are equal and false otherwise
- `assertObjectsEqual` : a function that takes in 2 objects and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise
- `map` : a function that takes in an array and a callback and returns a new array based on the results of the callback on each item in the array
- `takeUntil` : a function that takes in an array and callback and returns a slice of the array based on the criteria specified in the callback
- `findKey` : a function that takes in an object and callback and returns the first key that meets the criteria specified in callback
